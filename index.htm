        <p>After exhausting ourselves talking about the publishing industry pitfalls-the
            depressing royalty rates, the
            unbreakable barrier set for newcomers, the utterly incomprehensible contracts, the unreasonable demands for
            control over the product, just to name a handful-we decided to take matters in on our hands and, following
            the
            popular phrase, be the change we wanted to see in the world</p>
        <p>The Writers&#8217; Cabinet came to life as an act of revolt against conventional publishing and the
            royalty-oriented
            industry. We want good literature, more choices, new voices. <strong>We want art!</strong> The Great Story
            is our Cabinet&#8217;s
            first, second, and third priority. We want to bring interesting, beautiful, inspiring, breathtaking,
            intense,
            wild stories to the world.</p></div>
